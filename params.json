I've being studying Machine Learning and Computer Vision since undergrad (around 2009). Currently, I've finished my masters and I'm looking forward to have experiences in applying and developing new technologies specially computer vision related. Below there's a list of my past experiences, achievements and personal projects, I hope you enjoy.\r\n\r\n# Work Experiences\r\n## Fundep \r\n*Software Engineer. may/2015 - march/2016*\r\n\r\nWorking as a Software engineer at Fundep, i had the opportunity to learn a little bit about Fuzzy Authentication, Error Correcting Codes and Audio Signal Processing. The project was to build a Fuzzy Authentication Protocol making use of the environment sound to derive an authentication key. This key is used to safely authenticate two devices close to each other. It was a pleasure to be part of such a team (2 Engineers, 2 Professors, 2 PhD Students and 1 undergrad student). \r\n\r\nFirst, we developed a python prototype of the whole project. Afterwards, we developed a C (C99) library for implementing the protocol.\r\n\r\nAchievements: Optimization of the core algorithm (error correcting code) runtime from 45 minutes (MATLAB version) to 1.5 seconds (C version). by applying a DP algorithm (forward-backward) to compute posterior distributions, and by re-designing the code architecture as well as fine tunning the parameters.\r\n\r\nTechnologies used: LAPAC/BLAS, FFTW, C, Python.\r\n\r\n# Academic Experience\r\n## Msc. Thesis: Keypoints from Visual and Depth Data (KVD).\r\nI had the opportunity to build a new keypoint (kp) detector fusing intensity and range information. The kp detector extracts a light qualitative descriptor and feeds it to a previously trained decision tree model for keypoint classification. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the already expected benefits of the information fusion (such as illumination and scale robustness) it has also shown very good performance even on common 2D intensity images scenarios such as translational motion, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods.\r\n\r\nAchievements:\r\n**Best Paper Award**: _Vasconcelos, Levi O., Erickson R. Nascimento, and Mario FM Campos. “A Scale Invariant\r\nKeypoint Detector Based on Visual and Geometrical Cues.” Progress in Pattern Recognition, Image Analysis,\r\nComputer Vision and Applications.
